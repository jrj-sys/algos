// duplicates problem
// tally up duplicate entries in an array

// need a function that takes in an array and returns the x numbers of times y appeared

// two variables
// one that tracks the value that appears the most
// one that tracks how many times it has appeared

// loop over array => count occurences 
  // loop again => compare
    // if they're the same, increase counter

  // if counter > current most appearing count
    // update "most" variable to match

// return most appearing value & count
